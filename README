Dw
DW is a experimental lisp-like scripting language.
Right now is nearly useless.

Examples:


(+ 5 7)
=> 12

5 (* 5 1)
=>[5 5]

let x (def (+ 4 2))
=> //some tokens

call x
=> 6


The lexer is really stable and even uses message passing to send tokens to the parser.
Tree building is quite ugly and there is room for optimization.
Parsing is really messy and there are lots of this to improve
 (hint, using std.variant all the way around[quite useful but costly < I think >] )
